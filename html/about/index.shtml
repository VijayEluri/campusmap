<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
	UCSDMap is a web-based application for finding the locations of, and shortest
	paths between, buildings or areas on the campus. A Java (Swing) editor is used
	to enter information about locations and the paths between them. This data is
	then converted to a graph, optimized, and exported in a format that can be
	read by a web interface. In the interface, one or two locations can be
	selected from a drop-down menu, or searched for via a text field. If one
	location is selected, the map is centered on that spot. If two are selected,
	both are displayed and the shortest path between them is highlighted, along
	with the distance of the path and approximate walking time.
