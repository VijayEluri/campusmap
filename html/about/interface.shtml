<h2>Interface Features</h2>

<h3>Location name labels:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Colored based on whether the location was entered in the start or
	  end box
		<ul>
		<li>label is colored green if entered in the start box, red if
		  entered in the end box.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If there's no room to display the location label to the right of
	  the location then it will be displayed on the left.
		<ul>
		<li>Exception: when the label cannot be displayed either on the
		  left or the right. (If this happens, both location names
		  still appear to the left of the map.)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>These rules for displaying of the location labels hold while moving
	  on the map. 	</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Moving and zooming with the map:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Navigation bar operations:
		<ul>
		<li>Navigation arrows: pan to the North, South, East, or West.</li>
		<li>Circle (in the center of the navigation arrows): returns the</li>
		  map to the default zoom and center of the currently
		  displayed path or location (the same as clicking the
		  &quot;submit&quot; button again).</li>
		<li>Zoom bar:
			<ul>
			<li>Plus and Minus arrows: Moves to the next lower or
			  higher zoom level.</li>
			<li>Ovals: Go directly to zoom level. (Red oval
			  represents current zoom level)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Clicking on the map centers the map on the point clicked</li>
	<li>Clicking on the thumbnail (upper right) centers the map on
	  the point clicked</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Thumbnail:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Show the overall view of the map</li>
	<li>Blue rectangle shows the current map display</li>
	<li>If applicable, green and red boxes indicate the start and end</li>
	  locations
	<li>Thumbnail is synchronized with map operations and vice versa</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Searching for a location:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A location can be typed into either the start or end box near the
	  top of the page or selected in the drop down menu
	<li>Fuzzy matching for typed location names
		<ul>
		<li>When there is only one close match: Auto-corrects and
		  displays the location</li>
		<li>Displays a list of hyperlinks when there are multiple close
		  matches (sorted by closeness)
			<ul>
			<li>If the other entry field has a valid (or
			  auto-corrected) location entered, the list of
			  hyperlinks contains the distance of each suggested
			  location to the valid location (or infinity if it
			  cannot be reached).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The desired location can be displayed by clicking on the
		  corresponding hyperlink
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Displaying of shortest known path between locations:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>When two locations are entered, the shortest known path is found
	  between the two points
		<ul>
		<li>Computation of the shortest path is accomplished using
		  Dijkstra's Algorithm on provided datafiles</li>
		<li>Datafile properties can be set to stop the shortest path
		  from going through certain locations (so people aren't</li>
		  directed to walk through buildings)</li>
		<li>Datafile properties can be set to allow for bridges and
		  tunnel</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Information of the path is displayed to the left of the navigation
	  bar:
		<ul>
		<li>The from (start) location is underlined and labeled in green</li>
		<li>The to (end) location is underlined and labeled in red</li>
		<li>The distance between the two location is displayed in miles.</li>
		<li>The time it takes to walk between the two locations is
		  displayed based on entry of walking speed (15min/mile
		  default)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The path is displayed on the map:
		<ul>
		<li>The path is drawn in blue on the map between the two labeled
		  locations</li>
		<li>The drawn path will maintain itself through different zoom
		  levels and recentering</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Default display:
		<ul>
		<li>The highest zoom level is used such that all of the path can
		  still be displayed on the map.
			<ul>
			<li>Thus, by default, all elements of the path will be
			  viewable (Exception: when the path is too big for
			  the lowest zoom level)
				<ul>
				<li>In this case, the display centers on the end
				  location</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Data caching:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>All displayed paths are cached and will be retrieved if they are
	  requested again
		<ul>
		<li>Caching prevents the need to load two of the main datafiles
		  and run Dijkstra's algorithm.</li>
		<li>This allows for faster zooming and moving around the map
		<li>The length of time that the cache files are retained is
		  adjustable (currently 10 minutes)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>You can find the distance to the nearest food facility by entering a
	  start location and &quot;food&quot; for the end location</li>
	</ul>
