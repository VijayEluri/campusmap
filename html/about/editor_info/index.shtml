<h2>About the Editor</h2>

<p>
	The editor is used to add paths (representing, appropriately enough,
	foot paths or roads) and locations (representing buildings or
	landmarks) to a base image.

</p>

<p>
	This is a screenshot of the editor in use. The base image is simply a
	greatly enlarged version of the parking map. (The map used inside the
	editor is designed to be purely functional -- it's notably uglier than
	a different version of the same map that's used in the interface.)
	
	Many of the foot paths in the area have been entered, and you can see
	them going between locations, crossing each other, etc:

</p>

<p>
	Any base image may be used, so paths may be entered for any area (such
	as the UCSD campus). The only limitation is that the area covered can't
	be <i>too</i> large, or shortest-path calculations become too slow.

</p>


<h2>Optimization</h2>

<p>
	Data is entered as a series of &quot;paths&quot;, which are nothing
	more than a series of points connected by lines. Each click adds
	another point to the end of a path. Each path is independent they may
	cross, but nothing special happens when they do. In order to do
	anything useful with the paths, they must be transformed into a graph.

</p>

<p>A single path made up of four points (with a location &quot;Here&quot; attached to one point):</p>

<p>A second path has been added (with a location &quot;There&quot; attached to a point), criss-crossing the first:</p>
<img src="before.png">

<p>
	The same two paths have been run through PathOptimize (this is an
	option when saving the data) and have been turned into a planar graph:
	Each place two lines cross, a new point has been created to join the
	two lines (this can be suppressed when necessary, such as for bridges).
	The points are now nodes in a graph, connected by lines (vertices).
	Also, extraneous points that led nowhere were deleted.

</p>

<p>
	The data can now be exported to a format readable by the online
	interface, which can calculate shortest paths, etc.
