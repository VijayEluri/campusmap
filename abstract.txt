UCSDMap, A Short Prose Description:

UCSDMap is a web-based application for finding the location of, and shortest
path between, buildings or areas on the campus. Information about locations
and the paths between them are entered using a Java (Swing) editor, and exported
in a format that can be read by a web interface. In the interface, one or
two locations can be selected from a drop-down menu, or entered manually in a
text field. If a single location is selected, the map is centered on that
spot. If two are selected, both are displayed and the shortest path between
them is highlighted, along with the distance of the path and approximate
walking time.
