UCSDMap Interface Features:

Location name labels:
	- Colored based on whether the location was entered in the start or end box
		- label is colored green if entered in the start box, red if entered in the end box.
	- If the location label cannot be properly displayed to the right of the location (goes off screen) then it will be flipped to display on the left.
		- Exception: when the label cannot be displayed either on the left or the right
		(If this happens you can read it from the "from" or "to" label to the left of the map)
	- These rules for displaying of the location labels hold while moving on the map. 	

Moving and zooming with the map:
	- Navigation bar operations:
		- Navigation arrows: movement to the North, South, East, or West.
		- Circle (in the center of the navigation arrows): returns the map to the default zoom and center of the currently displayed path or location.
		- Zoom bar:
			- Plus and Minus arrows: Moves to the next lower or higher zoom level.
			- Ovals: Go directly to zoom level (Red oval represents current zoom level)
	- Clicking anywhere on the map centers the map on the location clicked.
	- Clicking anywhere on the thumbnail (upper right) centers the map on the location clicked

Thumbnail:
	- Show the overall view of the map
	- Blue rectangle shows the current map display
	- If applicable, green and red boxes indicate the start and end locations
	- Thumbnail is synchronized with map operations and visa versa

Entering a location to search for:
	- A location can be typed into either the Start or End box near the top of the page or selected in the drop down menu
	- Fuzzy Matching for typed location names
		- When there is only one close match: Auto-corrects and displays the location
		- Displays a list of hyperlinks when there are multiple close matches (Matches are sorted by closeness)
			- If the other entry field has a valid (or auto-correcting) location entered, the list of hyperlinks
			  contains the distance of each suggested location to the valid location (or infinity if it cannot be reached).
		- The desired location can be displayed by clicking on the corresponding hyperlink

Displaying of shortest known path between locations:
	- When two locations are entered, the shortest known path is found between the two points
		- Computation of the shortest path is accomplished using Dijkstra's Algorithm on provided datafiles
	- Information of the path is displayed to the left of the navigation bar:
		- The from (start) location is underlined and labeled in green
		- The to (end) location is underlined and labeled in red
		- The distance between the two location is displayed in miles.
	        - The time it takes to walk between the two locations is displayed based on entry of walking speed (15min/mile default)
	- The path is displayed on the map:
		- The path is drawn in blue on the map between the two labeled locations
		- The drawn paths will maintain itself through zoom levels, recentering, and moving changes
	- Default display:
		- The highest zoom level is used such that all of the path can still be displayed on the map.
			- Thus, by default, all elements of the path will be viewable (Exception: when the path is too big for the lowest zoom level)

Data caching:
	- A displayed path is cached and will be retreived if a path is asked to be recalculated
		- Thus, both the main datafiles do not need to loaded and the shortest path does not need to be calculated if previously calculated
		- This alows for faster zooming and moving around the map
		- The length of time for the cache files to be retain can be variably adjusted

Notes and features:
	- Due to the data passed in
