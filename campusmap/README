This is the App Engine version of CampusMap.

This version uses entirely pre-generated paths. No online Dijkstra's algorithm
at all (partly because we can't generate images with App Engine). The list of
locations must also be converted to html for inclusion in the main page.

To prepare the static content, run offline-paths.pl and offline-locations.pl,
in /cgi-bin.
